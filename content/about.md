## About me

Hi, I'm Caleb Brown. Thanks for visiting my website.

I live in Australia in a city called Wollongong, just south of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales.

I'm happily married to my beautiful wife Heather.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer for Google Australia with the Open Source Security Team.
