My mate David went to Japan over the Christmas break. He went to a restaurant and took a photo of one of the more poorly translated menu items.

Being an avid reader of <a href="http://www.engrish.com">engrish.com</a> I suggested he post it. Instead he gave it to me and I sent it in and four months later it's now featured on their home page (for the 27th of March).

You too can now enjoy the <a href="http://www.engrish.com/recent_detail.php?imagename=rosso-spumante.jpg&date=2006-05-27">Rosso Spumante</a>.
