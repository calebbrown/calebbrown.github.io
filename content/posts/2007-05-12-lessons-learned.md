While I was having a conversation with Steve our youth minister after church tonight, Sam and one of his friends came by us wrestling over a hat.

Steve said "here's trouble", then asked what they were fighting over. Sam said that his friend wouldn't give his hat back. His friend said that Sam wouldn't give <i>his</i> hat back.

At this point my brain scrolled through the list of things to say. I couldn't take a side, because I didn't know who's hat it was. I didn't want to participate in their boyish tussle either. And then somehow it clicked. I'd seen this problem solved before.

So I said "I know I'll cut the hat in half and give one half to each of you". Sam quickly replied "yeah, do it" - oblivious to what he'd just walked into. Steve picking up on it instantly said "well we know its not your hat Sam" and he promptly let go as Steve and I lost it.

I could barely believe he fell for it. I didn't think a <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%203:16-28;&version=31;">Solomon style</a> comment would ever have worked.

The irony was that Pippett had started the sermon earlier tonight talking about learning lessons from other people's mistakes.<!--more-->
