I love music and the internet has certainly fostered that love. No longer do I have to depend just on the radio, friendly recommendations and music-store-serendipity to find music I might like. With the Internet I can now pull up an artist's bio, scan through a complete discography, sample their music, listen to similar artists, and then buy the single song I was looking for.

So I thought I'd share some of the sites that I've found and use regularly (see below). You probably know some of them already, but if I missed one, leave it in the comments.<!--more-->

Places to find music and to tell people what you like and what you listen to:

 - <a href="http://hypem.com/">Hype Machine</a> - a music blog aggregator which has a handy player for playing mp3s added to the blogs. Good place to find new stuff.
 - <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> - Find what people with similar tastes to yours are listening too. Tracks the music you play to do it. (<a href="http://last.fm/user/triclops">my account</a>)
 - <a href="http://www.ilike.com">iLike</a> - Kinda like last.fm. I haven't played with it, but it's bigish on facebook.

Places to get information about music (other than <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a> of course):

 - <a href="http://allmusic.com/">All Music</a> - a super-good database of music information. There's so much content in here.
 - <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/">Song Meanings</a> - ever wondered what a musician was thinking when they wrote a song? Well you won't find those answers here, just a whole lot of user speculation.
 - <a href="http://www.coversproject.com/">Covers Project</a> - another social site attempting to capture who's covering who. Handy.

Places to get music:

 - <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">iTunes Store</a> - the usual place to go. A slick experience. Only buy iTunes Plus though.
 - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?ie=UTF8&node=163856011">Amazon's mp3 download service</a> - very cool. Major labels are selling music without copy protection through Amazon. But only available in the USA presently.
 - <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">eMusic</a> - no copy protection, quality mp3 downloads, very cheap, not a lot of pop. They've stopped unregistered users from browsing too. Bit of a bummer.

Bonus sites:

 - <a href="http://www.songtapper.com">SongTapper</a> - find songs by tapping the spacebar
 - <a href="http://www.midomi.com/">Midomi</a> - find songs by humming or singing it
 - <a href="http://songza.com/">Songza</a> - a more traditional search, but a very shmick interface
 - <a href="http://flashbackradio.com/">Flashback Radio</a> - the best 80s internet radio station

<small>Honorable mentions: Pandora (incredible music player, no longer available in Australia) and SeeqPod (handy search tool, ethically questionable)</small>
