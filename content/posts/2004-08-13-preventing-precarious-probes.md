This was too good to pass up. Sometimes when you use <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> to search for something particular you often stumble upon little gems.

While hunting down a particular <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com">simpsons</a> <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0515.htm">episode</a> I stumbled across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0609802631/002-8262583-6152031?v=glance">this book</a> being sold on amazon.

Seriously there are some weird people out there. To write a serious book about an area that borders on fiction, a topic that is so driven by paranoia, conspiracies and the delusional, is just strange, and almost frivolous. Mind you I find psychics and mediums strange and close to fiction, but they have more plusable results than anything I've seen produced by someone who believes that aliens like to exploit the population of earth.
