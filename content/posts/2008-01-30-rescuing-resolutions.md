<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution">New Year's Resolutions</a> tend to be given a rough treatment by society. The popular expectation is that no one will succeed at anything they label a new year's resolution. However despite knowing this people continue to set resolutions. I suspect the idea of self improvement is so desirable it leads people to make resolutions. But it seems the idea of self improvement is desirable only until the point of first failure, after which we try to ignore our lonely goal while it follows us around, nagging loudly, until we give it another chance at the next New Year celebration.

People really need to learn to factor failure into their resolution setting, and make the end of the year the deadline - not the 2nd of January.<!--more-->
