I rocked up to work today and my boss is 'dealing' with a mouse caught in a mouse trap with the blunt end of a stick.

Animals with exoskeletons are much easier to kill for some reason. I don't mind crushing a spider or cockroach underfoot, but something with fur is a little harder. Especially when its dirty and it will stink and there is no good meat on it to eat. No sweet, juicy red meat. No tender tissue to sink ones teeth into and enjoy. No succulent steaks. Mmm... Steak...

I think I'll go and get something to eat.
