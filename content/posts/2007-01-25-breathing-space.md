You know how you sometimes put your hand into a pocket, or you look into a bag, and find a $20 note lying around.

Well, as I was doing some budgeting for my upcoming trip, I decided to double check the actual money in my bank accounts.

Up until now I had been making rough guesses as to how much money I had, and I was beginning to get worried that I might be sailing a bit too close to the wind (especially since I might be unemployed for 4 months).

After double checking the finances, it turns out I have about 2K more than I thought. Which is a huge relief and may mean I will be able to pull this thing off after all.
