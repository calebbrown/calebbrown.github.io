Okay, I fiddled with the dates. They are now always gonna be GMT+10. Unfortunately they were GMT-8, so now all the dates on the previous blog entries are screwed. I'm not gonna fix them, you can do the maths - add 18 hours and you should be close.

In the effort of procastination I registered the domain: calebbrown.id.au. There is nothing there at the moment, just an email address (I now have 8), but eventually it will become the basis for a newer, more superiour blogging system, with even more information about your's truely.

Its been many years coming, but my evil scheme of establishing a dominant web presence which I shall then use to take over the world is finally gaining some momentum.

muahahahaha....
