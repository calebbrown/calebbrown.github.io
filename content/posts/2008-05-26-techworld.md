Just thought I'd put out a gratuitous plug for <a href="http://www.techworld.com.au/">TechWorld</a> - a website we've just pushed live at work.

For those who don't know I work for <a href="http://www.idg.com.au">IDG Communications</a> (think PC World or ComputerWorld - tech media) and I've been working on this site for a little while now so I'm very happy to have it going live.

Included on the site is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701213205/http://www.techworld.com.au/blog/entrenched">a blog</a> that I contribute to. That is where I plan on geeking out on things that are Tech and Programming related, so if you're interested in that sort of thing check it out.<!--more-->
