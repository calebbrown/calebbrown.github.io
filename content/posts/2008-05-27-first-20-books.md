<small>Completed: 11th January</small>
Good ideas about web usability. Lots of detail. A bit dated. Some opinions I disagree with.

<small>Completed: 24th March</small>
Very well written (err, translated?) intriguing story. The supernatural themes and alternative gospel account probably lessened it's appeal.

<small>Completed: 28th April</small>
Similar but broader than Escape from Reason. Seeks to address the question of evangelism in a world with a moving worldview. Dense, but good.

<small>Completed: 12th May</small>
A strong call to action for Christians in countries that are turning away from Christian roots. Solid biblical basis. Good read.

<small>Completed: 16th May (well 26th of May including the bits at the end)</small>
Fantastic, engaging story. More detail than the movie, but Goldman's interjections are annoying. Very fun read.
