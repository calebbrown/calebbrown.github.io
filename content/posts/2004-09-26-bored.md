I am so bored right now. Judging by the content of my previous messages today you've probably already realised that. 

So far today I've been to church, I've shaved my head, I've watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038355/">The Big Sleep</a> (its very good, watch it), I've watched the Roosters beat the Cowboys (I was kinda hoping the Cowboys would win being the underdogs and all), I've watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/">Black Hawk Down</a>, I've checked <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au">smh</a> and a dozen of my other regular sites more than twice including various blogs I seldom read.

I've drunk a 600mL bottle and a 1.25L bottle of <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com.au/">Coke</a>, I finished a box of <a href="http://www.cadbury.com.au/sites/cadbury/index.php?pageId=66">cadbury favourites</a>, I've had a meat pie and a quarter pounder and a cup off instant coffee.

I've checked my email numerous times, did some research on the history of hyperspace, looked at the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au">weather forecast</a>, checked Australia's position on the 2004 paralympics medal tally, discovered some nifty easter eggs for my dodgy old nokia phone.

Finally I spent the wee hours of this morning (aka last night) researching queensland liquor laws because my brother who is on holidays had his drivers license confiscated by a bouncer cause they thought it was a fake (btw it has all turned out okay so far, I'm sending my brother his birth certificate so he can get a proof of age card while his license makes its way back home).

What I haven't done that I probably should have done is complete some timesheets so I can get some money (I will do some before I sleep). I also didn't do any work on my thesis like I thought I would - I've had one of those afternoons where you want to be a little productive but on something completely different because all the usual things are not interesting.

So there you have it. That is what a person is driven to when their family goes away and leaves no one to argue with. I think I might play some music for a break from the sound of television or maybe I'll have an early night.
