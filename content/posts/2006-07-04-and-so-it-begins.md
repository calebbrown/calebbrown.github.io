From <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/misskheyhey">Kylie's blog</a>:
<blockquote>My friend Caleb and I are starting a blogging war. He is jealous that my blog gets more hits than his. We decided that he needs to get embroiled in a scandal and blog about it to get some hits (there were suggestions of embezzlement and unwanted pregnancies). Check him out here so that he feels some love <a href="http://calebbrown.id.au/">http://inference.blogspot.com/</a> and when he gloats that he gets more hits than me, I can tell him its cause all my readers hit him up out of pity! hehehehe MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA - you will never win Caleb. NEVER!!!!!!</blockquote>
So apparently I'm at war. An innocent conversation about hit counts and how I can draw more traffic, and this is what happens.

I wonder what sort of content would bring the regulars back more frequently and what content will draw in a broader audience?

Just a reminder that you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Inference">syndicate</a> this blog in your favourite feed reader.
