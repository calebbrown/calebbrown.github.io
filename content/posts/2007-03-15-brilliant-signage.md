I was driving to work today and I was again impressed with the quality of work being done by the RTA.

One of the programmable overhead signs read as follows:

> ACCIDENT AHEAD, LANE CLOSED  
> PREPARE TO MERGE  
> \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>LEFT\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>

Obviously they were thinking of the other left.
