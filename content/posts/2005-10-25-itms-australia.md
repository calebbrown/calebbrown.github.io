So I woke up early this morning and because of the rumors I had been hearing I opened up itunes to see if the australia store was in fact being launched today.

To my surprise it was available so I went and created an account and downloaded a track or two. Prices are at $1.69 per track, which is a bit steep. Singles are a bit over $6 which is also expensive. EPs are about $11.49. Albums are $16.99. Not the exact price range I'd like and a bit too close to the cost of a CD from a store, but it'll be better for the one off song purchases.

After spend a little time looking around I went to see if there was any noise about it from <a href="http://www.apple.com.au">apple</a> or any other Australian media, but it seems they may be waiting until after the apple event to publicly announce it's availability.
