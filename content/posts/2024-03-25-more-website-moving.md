Again in my series of blog posts about moving my site, I have updated the theme and migrated from Jekyll to Hugo.

The [theme](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) looks better and has better mobile support too.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are very similar in their features for static site generators. I needed to change how I publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to allow for more processing steps, so I decided to switch.

Overall I'm hoping the change makes publishing easier, and leads to more frequent posting.
