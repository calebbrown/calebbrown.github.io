Just saw this awesome [interview with Rick Astley](https://web.archive.org/web/20080326042441/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html) on the LA Times where he comments on the "rickrolling" internet meme he is at the centre of.

For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept of "rickrolling" check out this enlightening <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0">introductory article</a> explaining what it is.
