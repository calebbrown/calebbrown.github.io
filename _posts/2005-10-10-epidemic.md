So we seem to be having a mouse epidemic at work. Today we have already killed 2. Over the weekend we got 3. This brings the total to about 11 or 12 in the last couple of weeks, which strikes me as being a rather large number.



I wonder where all these mice are coming from and how many more are still to be killed? Presently the supply seems limitless. Maybe there is some tasty morsel hidden in the building somewhere or a breeeding zone.



I think we need to get in a Pied Piper to deal with this.
