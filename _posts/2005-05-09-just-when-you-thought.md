<i>Mylo</i> has a track out called <i>In My Arms</i>.  Now that may not seem like noteworthy news until, that is, you realise the main sample in the song is from an old <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:w69ds33ba3zg~T00">Boy Meets Girl</a> song, called <i>Waiting for a Star to Fall</i>. Now unlike the two songs mentioned in my earlier post <a href="/node/35">here</a>, this track is a welcome dose of variety. Besides just having a short sample of the phrase "in my arms" repetitively used throughout, a highly predictable structure, and a severe lack of redeeming features besides its 'dancability' it is still much better than having two independent acts releasing essentially the same remix.

In any case I continue to hope for the centralised control of remixes and covers, because 'artists' really need to pick a new '80s track to make club accessible.
