I wonder if there is a market for an emergency toilet paper delivery service. An 'at call' service where, if you run out of toilet paper, you can give them a call and at a premium have a packet of toilet paper rushed to your door.

<!--break-->

To make it worth it for the business, the cost of a call out would need to be reasonable. But they could deliver high quality 3 ply tissue paper to make people feel like they're getting something, even though they get it really cheap because they buy it in bulk.



To make it a little more profitable they could even do scheduled deliveries (kinda like the water guy) to ensure you always have enough.



Alternatively they could drive up and down the back streets, like a Mr Whippy, selling packs like ice cream to desperate parents. I wonder what song they'd play. Maybe 'Take the Pressure Down' by John Farnham.
