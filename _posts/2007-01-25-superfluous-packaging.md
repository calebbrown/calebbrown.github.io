<p>So this box containing a computer part (pictured in front) we ordered from <a href="http://umart.net">umart</a> arrived at work arrived yesterday. Its not fragile, yet it came in more packaging than a hard disk that arrived last week. The box could fit at least another 20 of them.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a lack of appropriately sized boxes in Sydney at the moment...</p>
