Hmm, this thing needs an update.



Well after deciding over two months ago I would take some time off I'm finally going to do it this week. I really should have taken it earlier. Oh well.



Last week my brother bought MacGyver season 1 on DVD and I bought Firefly and TinTin. I have since discovered that DVD boxsets are a huge contributing factor to my present tiredness. So far I have watched 3 of 6 MacGyver discs (2 in the last 2 days), all of FireFly and 1 of 6 TinTin discs. I still have a long way to go.



This isn't the first time I've stayed up late watching a TV/Anime series, but this is the first time I've had 3 different box sets to choose from. Hopefully I can nail them all soon so I can get some rest. Or maybe I can watch them like any other sensible person and go to bed on time and get the other things done I should be doing.



Maybe I can finish watching them all on my upcoming break... Or maybe I'll just work on one of my <a href="http://www.talklibrary.com" title="Don't bother there is nothing there yet">hair brained schemes</a>
