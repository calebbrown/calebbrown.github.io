Through some weird twists and turns I stumpled upon <a href="http://www.textfiles.com">this</a> site last night. In particular one <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/media/arnold.txt">file</a> on the site caught my attention.



Being an avid Arnold Schwarzenegger fan I found the articles relevancy, despite its age of more than 13 years, rather suprising. Arnold is certainly well on his way to fulfilling the vision of this article and I look forward to seeing if America will make allowances for him to further his political career beyond the limit he has already obtained.
