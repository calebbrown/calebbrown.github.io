So I am at work and have completely forgotten what it is that I was meant to be doing today. 4 days is enough time for everything you have about work in your head to leave. Especially if you have other things to distract you more than normal.

Employers must hate 4 day weekends because they know the next day back is going to be more unproductive than a monday usually would be.
