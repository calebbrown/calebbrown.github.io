I read an article titled <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/click-here-to-give-em-the-flick/2007/04/02/1175366127495.html" target="_blank"> Click here to give 'em the flick</a> on <a href="http://www.smh.com.au" target="_blank">SMH</a>.

It's an article describing some research about how teenagers are playing out their relationships more and more online.

I found the following quote particularly sad. Despite desiring physical interaction teens still resort to a cheaper, unsatisfying, alternative online. While they now have "far greater access to networked publics" I think they also have greater access to the mall and movie theatres than I ever had when I was their age.

<blockquote>
Boyd also observed that technology had made it far more common for relationships to be played out in cyberspace - over instant-messaging tools and MySpace - than in the real world.

"While physical interactions are deeply desired, they are typically quite rare," she said.

"Although the mall and move [sic] theater are still desired outtings [sic] for teen couples, many have far greater access to networked publics like MySpace than they do to unmediated publics."
