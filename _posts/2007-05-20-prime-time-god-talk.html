I am sitting here writing this blog post as <a href="http://www.rove.com.au/" target="_blank">Rove McManus</a> interviews <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Denton" target="_blank">Andrew Denton</a> about his recent recent (2006) visit to the <a href="http://www.nrb.org/" target="_blank">National Religious Broadcasters</a> convention in Texas. The thought has just dawned on me that never in my adult lifetime has there been an easier time to speak openly about religion.<br />
<br />
What makes it strange is that it isn't the usual religious content you find on a light comedy/variety show on a Sunday evening - the quick one liners poking fun at a recent religious faux pas. Instead it is a serious look at a big Christian centric event (well as serious as variety shows get) and it feels slightly misplaced because there aren't the usual array of jokes being fired off.<br />
<br />
There has been an obvious change, and I think the catalyst for this has, in part, been due to the increasing concern about terrorism, its relationship to Islam and fundamentalism. I think its also related to a deep desire people have to feel a sense of meaning with their lives or to have some spiritual experience.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case we can no longer claim that people are unwilling to talk about what they believe in. As a Christian there are more opportunities than ever for me to be sharing what I believe. If Rove can talk about it, then I have no excuse.<!--break--><br />
