Apparently I have <a href="http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/13362.cfm">acute gastritis</a>. Since tuesday I've had a pain in my stomach region and I finally saw a doctor about it today. Got drugs now, but I can't drink fizzy drink, which unfortunately includes <a href="http://www.coke.com/">Coca-Cola</a>. I guess I probably should stick away from other acidic things too.



My biggest question now is what caused this nagging pain? On sunday I ate some Subway and some roast pork/lamb that was a little cold, but well cooked. On monday I didn't eat much. I had a lot of chocolate eggs though and a double shot espresso, plus a bottle of coke and a couple of big pieces of chicken for dinner. On Tuesday I had some funky ham for lunch.



Or maybe it was stress related?



In any case it'd be nice if it was gone.
