For those who care my blog is now running on <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal 5.7</a> instead of the v4.5 it was on before. Amusingly enough v6.0 is almost out now.



Comments have been broken and should be working again now. Most of the site is the same except a few small look and feel changes.



The new version allows me a little more flexibility which I'd like to try out, so things might change over the next few months a bit more dramatically.
