I have finally taken the source code to this blog and stuck it up on GitHub.

It doesn't have much in the way of documentation yet, but feel free to poke around and see how I've implemented this blog. I'm more than happy to hear any feedback.

In the coming months I plan to add more documentation, tests and to make it more resusable.

So don't wait any longer, go and [check out the source](https://github.com/calebbrown/calebcc)!
