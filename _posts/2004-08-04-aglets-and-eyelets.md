After my post the other day about <a href="./bl-sg-07">my trendy new pens</a>. I began wondering what other websites there are out there for the mundane and trivial items in this world.



So I decided to do a quick google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=shoelaces">shoelaces</a>. Oh the weird things people write about. The <a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/">first result</a> is a page written by a guy who lives in Melbourne Australia, called Ian, who, among other things, has developed his own technique for tieing shoelaces. I found it rather interesting. I'd never thought of using heatshrink to fix aglets on shoelaces.



So my question is this: What is the most useless item with a product page or a entire site dedicated to it on the internet?
