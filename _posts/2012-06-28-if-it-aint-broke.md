After a few months of running the new site I thought it's time to get
posting again. To start with I thought I'd explain what thinking went into
deciding to rebuild it.

### Origins

I started blogging back in July 2004. Originally I was using
[Google's Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) which worked well enough for a
time. It was quick to setup and use.

Eventually I decided it would be better to have my blog running under
my own domain. So in August 2006 I moved it onto a self hosted install of
[Drupal](http://drupal.org). Despite taking a small step backwards in terms
of design I now *owned* my content and could do anything I wanted with my blog.

So after 6 years why the big change?

### Unsettled

Short answer: I was unsettled. The blog was stagnating and I needed to do
something. My last proper post was nearly four years ago and I had grown
up from posting random observations and crazy ideas.

What I wanted to do was turn [calebbrown.id.au](http://calebbrown.id.au) into a place
where I could stick my résumé, project links and tech blog posts - as well
as post about other things going on in my life. How this was going to happen with the old blog I wasn't quite sure.

Along with this, Drupal and PHP were no longer the technologies I wanted to
work with or have my website run on.


### Lightsabers and Blogs

While I was thinking and looking for a new way to run my blog over the last few
years I read a blog post entitled
[Be a Good Jedi: Build Your Own Blog](http://wekeroad.com/2009/08/10/be-a-good-jedi-build-your-own-blog).

The author talks about how developers should build their own blogging engines
like Jedis build their own Lightsabers. As a web developer that idea really
resonated with me -- what I write about on my blog says as much about me as
the software it runs on.

So I decided that if I'm going to make my blog the place I talk web
development then the software it runs on needs to demonstrate that I might
have some clue about what I talk about.

And besides, none of the existing engines I could find matched the way I
wanted mine to work, so making one seemed like a natural choice.


### The Blog

So after about a year in the making here is the result! Something that is
almost a static blog, uses the disk for data storage and is written in
Python -- checkout the [about page](/about) if you want a little more detail.

Finally, in the next month or so, once I clean up the repo and stick in
a license file and some docs I'll open source it - so stay tuned.
