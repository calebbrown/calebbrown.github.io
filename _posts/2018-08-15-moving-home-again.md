It seems I only update this blog when I change how I host it.

I have now moved it to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com).

I now say "goodbye" to [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com) who have served
me well for many years.

<!--break-->
There are a few reasons for deciding to move.

Firstly, I don't want the complexity of maintaining a hosting service and
worrying about security and ensuring my software is running. In the future if I
need "hosting" services I'll use Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services.

Secondly, I don't want to spend the money. The hosting was cheap, but
subscription costs add up. Given that I was barely using the service, it didn't
seem right to be paying for the service.

So if you're interested in the source - go and check out the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/calebbrown/calebbrown.github.io).
