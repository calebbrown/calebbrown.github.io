Well its now been a year since I drank my last coke. For those who care I now get my caffeine fix from coffee, so I can't say that its been entirely healthy.

During this year I gave away 1 large coke from MacDonalds and threw away another because I forgot to change it to something else. I also managed to go through an entire week long camp without a coffee or a coke, which is quite an achievement considering that in previous years I had averaged more than 4 cans of coke a day and was staying up till at least 2am and waking up at no later than 8am.

The question now is do I continue abstaining, or do I hang up my hat and just start drinking it again.

I leave that as a question for my readers to discuss.
