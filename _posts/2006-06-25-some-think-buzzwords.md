This morning I saw an advert on TV for <a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com">Credit Suisse</a> - some sort of Swiss bank. You can watch the advert too by following the link to "TV Spot 2" on their <a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com/who_we_are/en/ad_campaign.html">current ad campaign</a> page. The ad consists (much like the pdf's on that afore mentioned page) of a statement: 'some think ...', followed by a redefinition in their terms: 'we think ...'.

What left me gob-smacked was that each alternative they presented was essentially a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword ">buzzword</a>. Their redefinitions changed a simple meaningful phrase into meaningless corporate drivel. The worst is by far this one: "<a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com/who_we_are/doc/ad_campaign_fishing_en.pdf">Some think two generations. We think succession planning</a>".

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but why are they using buzzwords as the basis for their marketing campaign? Who goes for this sort of stuff?
