This is from an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/surprise-delays-terror-sentence/2006/07/13/1152637782619.html">article</a> today on SMH:
<blockquote>Faheem Khalid Lodhi, 36, of Lakemba, had planned to attack the Australian electricity supply system, likely causing widespread death and destruction.</blockquote>
Without knowing exactly what this guy specifically planned on doing, I find it difficult to see how an attack on the Australian electricity system would <i>likely</i> cause 'widespread death and destruction'.

Firstly hospitals have backup generators so no deaths there. A power plant blowing up might kill the staff and destroy the station, but thats not exactly widespread.

Maybe the death will come from people starving because the food in the fridge has all gone off, or from eating raw chicken. Perhaps the destruction will come from people going crazy with the sudden shock of not having working phones and internet and all the modern appliances that make our lives easier.

Really SMH we don't need this sort of sensationalism in our media.
