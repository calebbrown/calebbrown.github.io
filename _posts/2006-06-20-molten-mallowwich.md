Living out of home means that you have to cook for yourself. Today I decided to get experimental and make something I call the Molten Mallowwich.



The Molten Mallowwich is basically a toasted sandwich with marshmallows on it.



I tried it with 9.



I ended up with molten marshmallow on my hands and face.



Next time I'll use 4 to 6. Maybe I'll mix it up with some peanut butter or jam too.



In case you're wondering, I had the idea on a camp a number of years ago. Its a cross between cooking marshmallows on a fire and using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffle_iron">jaffle iron</a> to make toasted sandwiches on a fire.
