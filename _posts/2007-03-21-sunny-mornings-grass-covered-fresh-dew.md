The last 14 days have been quite tumultuous<sup><a href="#14dfoot-1">1</a></sup>.

Here is a snapshot of some highlights:<ul>
  <li>Saturday Night: I decided to be more disciplined, and as apart of that I've been waking between 6:30 and 7:00am on weekdays to get stuff done</li>
  <li>Tuesday: I attended a funeral for a friend from the Uniting Church who passed away</li>
  <li>Wednesday: My sister had her daughter - which means I became an uncle</li>
  <li>Wednesday Evening: Had one of the most heated and challenging bible studies of the whole year</li>
  <li>Thursday: Left work early to inspect an okay property we had complete certainty we would get - and <i>didn't</i> take it</li>
  <li>Saturday: Spent 3 hours in a travel agent and booked my flights to South America</li>
  <li>Sunday: Went to a lunch to support some of our church's missionaries. Got to sure up the plans to visit them in Chile later this year and was the only person under the age of 30 at the lunch who wasn't there because their parents brought them</li>
  <li>Monday: Had a fiasco getting funds to pay for the tickets<sup><a href="#14dfoot-2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Tuesday: Had our application accepted for a really nice place we saw on Satuday</li>
</ul>

As a result I'm getting tired. But its not a lazy "I've achieved nothing" tired, but a satisfied type of tired that you feel after accomplishing something. I think the difference is being lazy means you fall asleep anxious about all the things you haven't done, whereas after working at something you fall asleep knowing time hasn't been wasted, and the uncompleted things aren't uncompleted due to laziness, but other priorities.

I wonder how long it will continue this way. While I'm totally wrecked at the end of the day, I feel much more energised. The world is presently more colourful and textured than it's been for a long time. So I don't mind if it continues. Even indefinitely.

<sup><a name="14dfoot-1">1</a></sup> - tumultuous is now my official word of the year

<sup><a name="14dfoot-2">2</a></sup> - never buy tickets on a Saturday that have a short TTL without (a) having the cash in the bank or (b) having a credit account.
