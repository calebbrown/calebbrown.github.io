When I go down to the local takeaway to get a drink I often find myself asking the question: Why do flavoured milk companies (Oak, Moove, etc) think that offering another 100mL on top of a 600mL milk drink would make someone more likely to buy your drink?

I like milk. I drink about a glass every day. I used to drink full cream (and would prefer it) until a <a href="/node/36">recent health incident</a>. I have it on cereal and in my coffee (although black is good too). I have it with milo too. But 600mL in one hit is about the limit. More than that and I feel a bit bloated. In fact I think the optimum size is about 500mL. In any case you can understand why I think adding more as a marketing ploy is stupid. I will not buy flavoured milk that is larger than 600mL.
