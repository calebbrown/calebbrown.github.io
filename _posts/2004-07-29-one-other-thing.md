Whats up with the blogger.com times on my posts?



They say AM instead of PM.



I swear I set them to PM.



I think they have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/">gremlins</a>.

Or maybe I've been mixing 24 hour time, which is far superior, with their 12 hour format.



In any case the problem has been fixed. And for those who like aggregators try <a href="http://inference.blogspot.com/atom.xml">this link</a>.
