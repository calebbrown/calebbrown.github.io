Merry Christmas everyone.

Right now I'm really tired after running around the city in the morning and then helping out at 4 church services from 3pm till 12am. However despite all that I'm really happy - and not just because of the imminent prospect of receiving presents, but because today we celebrate the birth of Jesus - not just some smart guy who lived 2000 years ago, but the eternal ruler of the universe. Who was sent to earth, as a man, by God, to restore our broken relationship with him - broken because of our rejection of his sovereignty over us. A rebellion punishable by death. 

So, while you unwrap the gifts and eat nice big meals, may I suggest that you spend some time thinking about what it is you're actually doing and why you are doing it. May I also suggest that you think about who this Jesus is and what he did. They are very closely related.

Anyway, I must sleep. I don't think I'll have much of a chance to sleep in tomorrow, so I guess I'll have to take what I can get.
