In an effort to reduce the noise in my inbox I have closed my long standing email address: amnot@hotpop.com.



As far as free email services go it has served me well. It gave me free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP3</a> email and wasn't hotmail at a time when it was king and free POP3 services were rare. Since then free webmail has changed dramatically. Google came along and gave enormous storage and a good interface and made everyone else pick up their game.



I'm not sad to see this address go. It was always a temporary stop gap until I bought <a href="http://calebbrown.id.au/">my own domain</a> and it had become so overrun with spam. It has served me well for the nearly 5 years I've had it.<!--break-->
