Well this is an interesting experience. At the moment, rather than hand crafting a blog entry in a web page, I'm using a neat application called <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a> to handle the hard work.



It has a button for including the current song in iTunes (which for the moment spits out: "<strong>The Careless Kind</strong> from the album "Six Feet Above Yesterday" by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Infusion%22">Infusion</a>")



It also lets me edit html at the click of a button and view the 'finished product'. Its actually quite impressive and if I did more of this stuff I may even consider forking out money.



Oh well back to sleeping.
