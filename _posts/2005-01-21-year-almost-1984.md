Its kinda scary seeing how close we are to an Orwellian society. I recommend going out and reading 1984 by George Orwell and then go over <a href="http://studentsfororwell.org/">here</a> and look at where we are at. I find it ironic that while the US prides itself on its freedom it is continues to become more and more oppressive.
