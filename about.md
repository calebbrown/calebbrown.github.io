# About me

Hi, I'm Caleb Brown.

I live in Australia in a city called Wollongong, just south of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales.

I'm happily married to my beautiful wife Heather.

I work as a Software Engineer for Google Australia.


# About the site

This sit is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/calebbrown/calebbrown.github.io).

The frontend is built using Twitter's awesome [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework.

And the image at the top of every page is one I took in 2009 at the Quiksilver in Memorial of Eddie Aiaku in Hawaii.
